    =>  The oxidation process turns the deep dark green color to yellow-green color. A chemical known as manganese oxide is then mixed with the glass cullet to it grey. The grey base is usually used as the primary color to which various other coloring dyes or agents are added to develop glass of various colors.

    title: 'Shoes Waste',
    about:
        'The problem is that shoes are inherently difficult to recycle. They can be made of a wide variety of materials, often spanning up to 40 different components, making it challenging to take shoes apart and recycle each piece accordingly. Additionally, there are a limited number of facilities that can cater to shoe recycling. The end result is that around 90% of the shoes we wear eventually end up in landfills.',
    methods: '''
    - Shoe cobblers can bring back shoes from the dead
    - Donate or consign any shoes that are still wearable
    - Sustainable footwear is also a alternative

    about:
        'General waste bin is the place for items that you would usually throw into the general waste bin at home. These are things that you wouldnâ€™t usually recycle, and that often end up in landfill. Where possible, you should separate your waste to maximise recycling opportunities.',
    methods:
        'Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state.[1] It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. It can also prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reducing energy use, air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from landfilling).',
